##  Demo

    style="float: center; margin-right: 10px; " /> 

Our toolkit is compatible with CC4, Microsoft-rocketbox, and DIDIMO 3D virtual humans. Due to the license restriction, we only include an example character and animations from Rocketbox characters. 

See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDT30Evpmic&feature=youtu.be) for full demo video of the possibilities with this toolkit.

### Main features

<img src=".//Documentations/images/System_Setup.png" alt="teaser"
    style="float: center; margin-right: 10px; " /> 
The image above shows the interaction loop of a conversational virtual agent. 

* Conversational intelligent virtual agents with human-AI interaction loop.
    - <b>multimodal prompting</b> : combining text-based user message with system prompt that contains a custom list of possible agent actions and facial expressions, with optional image prompt as support. 
    - <b>structure output from LLM/VLM</b>, containing selected action, facial expression, and text response.
    - <b>realistic IVA behavior</b> combining the multimodal output, including gaze, action, and facial expressions. 

* <b>Modulized cloud services</b> of speech-to-text, large language models and text to speech models to choose from
  * LLM/VLM: OpenAI GPT-4o (via server), Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4o, local LLM(GPT4All, very slow)
  * STT: Google cloud (via server), Whisper (local, but very slow!)
  * TTS: Eleven Labs, Google Cloud (via server), Azure

### Development Road Maps

Features coming soon: 
- update and improve documentation
- Add ``Unity_STT_GoogleCloud`` and ``Unity_STT_Azure``
- proximity detection in VR
- gesture recognition integration
- integration of more diverse publically avalibleble animations and more diverse ready-made animation controllers
- spatial understanding
- memory management for long term interaction

## Quick Start

### Open as Unity Project
1. Make sure you have the correct Unity version installed.
2. Clone this repository to the desired location by executing: git clone https://github.com/uhhhci/intelligent-virtual-agent-sdk-examples.git in a terminal or using your favorite Git tool. You can alternatively download the .zip file and extract it from there.
3. In Unity Hub, do "add project from disk" and select the folder "intelligent-virtual-agent-sdk-examples" from the location you cloned to


  #### Simple Agent
  - In the Project view, add `Packages/de.uhh.hci.ivh.core/Runtime/Prefabs/BasicServiceTemplate.prefab` to the ``conversationalAgent`` component

  - An example agent can be added by creating an empty Gameobject in the scene and adding the script: `Packages/de.uhh.hci.ivh.core/Runtime/Scripts/IntelligentVirtualAgent/ConversationalAgent.cs` to it. 
  
  - In its field "Agent Prefab" you can drag e.g.: `Packages/de.uhh.hci.ivh.core/Runtime/Models/Rocketbox/Business_Female_01/Export/Business_Female_01_facial.fbx`.

  - In its field "Animator Controller" you need to drag in `Packages/de.uhh.hci.ivh.core/Runtime/AnimationControllers/RocketboxFemale.controller`.

  - In the Emotion Handler Type, choose FACS. If you want more diverse and sophisicated facial expression animations, and if you have a license for CC4 digital soul facial expression animation database, see [CC4 Characters and Animations](#reallusion-animation).

  - In the CharacterType, choose ``Rocketbox`` if you are using rocketbox character. Choose ``CC4orDIDIMO`` otherwise. 

  - STT Trigger Settings, in ``Automatic`` mode, the IVA does not need to be triggered via developer defined trigger phrase. In ``Trigger Always``, the IVA will only respond to you if you started the conversation with a trigger phrase. This is developer's choice for ensuring trustworthy AI best practice. 

  - Any ``Additional Description`` will be added to the IVA's system prompt. 

  - Under the `Cloud Service Settings` in the Editor, choose the UHAM services for TTS, Foundation Model and STT Service.

  - In the ``BasicServerManager`` game object and in ``Google TTS``, choose the desired voice for your character. 

  - After you added both the Animator Controller and the agent model, click on `Setup Agent` in the Editor.

  - Add the `Packages/de.uhh.hci.ivh.core/Runtime/Prefabs/PreviewScenePrefab.prefab` to the scene for better lighting and appearance of the scene. 

  #### Advance Agent- with vision capability, proximity, etc (coming soon..)
  

## Connect to Cloud Services

For the main functions of the package you will need different API-keys. See the documentation in the [iva-server](https://github.com/uhhhci/iva-server) of how to get the API keys. 

- To connect to the core services you can use the [IVA Server](https://github.com/uhhhci/iva-server). In the BasicServiceTemplate in your scene you now need to set the IP to "localhost" the UHAMServerManager.

- If you are students at Hamburg University, you can connect via the UHAM hosted server, please contact your supervisor/admin for the IP adress. In the BasicServiceTemplate in your scene you can add this IP to the BasicServerManager.

If you are testing with the following cloud service, you should enter your API key in an ``auth.json`` file in the ``C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aiapi``
 directory for Unity to directly parse the API key: 

 ```json
{
    "openai_api_key": "YOUR API KEY",
    "gemini_api_key": "YOUR API KEY",
    "azure_subscription_key": "YOUR API KEY",
    "azure_endpoint_id": "YOUR API KEY",
    "eleven_labs_api_key": "YOUR API KEY"
}
 ```

You must not: resell the asset, redistribute the asset separately from this repository, or recreate, extract, or adapt the asset for use in any other project, product, or context.  See the detail [License](./LICENSE.md). 

## Rocketbox Characters License Notice

This repository includes 3D character assets sourced from the Rocketbox Avatar Library, originally developed by Rocketbox Studios and later made freely available by Microsoft for academic and non-commercial use.

The Rocketbox character models are provided under a **non-commercial license** and are intended **solely for academic, research, and educational purposes**. Use of these assets is subject to the original Rocketbox EULA provided by Microsoft, which can be found here:

## Mixamo Animations

Our package provides full support for mixamo animations. However, due to Adobe's redistribution limitation, we can not include the animation setup in the report. If you would like to use the different animations from Mixamo for your agents for your non-commerical research and academic work, please contact us. <b>We will be happy to provide you with a Unity-compatible animation package asset that has already been imported and configured, saving you the setup effort. </b>

## Reallusion Animation

The facial expressions of the Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) you migh thave seen in many demo videos in this project are animated using Reallusionâs Digital Soul asset library, which is protected under a restricted usage license. 

As per Reallusionâs licensing terms, we are not permitted to redistribute this asset directly through the repository. However, if you hold a valid license and seats for Reallusionâs Digital Soul, please contact us. <b>We will be happy to provide you with a Unity-compatible animation asset that has already been imported and configured, saving you the setup effort. </b> ð§ For licensed access, contact the maintainence team.
